# Welcome to Mint Office

# Introduction

## Prerequisites

RVM may be useful since ruby 1.9.2 is required.

Before using brew on OS X, make sure /usr/local is owned by you, not a strange code, in which installing "deployd" or "node" results. Otherwise "brew link" command is broken every time.

> 
brew install mysql

Refer to http://madebyhoundstooth.com/blog/install-mysql-on-mountain-lion-with-homebrew/ for details.

> 
brew install imagemagick

Consult to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13942443/error-installing-rmagick-on-mountain-lion in case you face a problem there.

## Setup

### Source code repository

> git clone git@g.mintech.kr:mintoffice.git
>
> cd mintoffice
>
> git checkout develop

### Installation

> 
bundle install

Sometimes installing a gem with native extensions causes difficult situations to resolve. In such a case, you need to look at files at the directory. For RVM,  ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-xxx/gems is the home.

### Configuration

Create your own config/database.yml (cf. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Of course, you should create a database (ex. mintoffice_development) on your DBMS.

Create your own oauth_key.yml (copying oauth_key.yml.example would do)

### Population

> rake db:migrate
>
> rake db:seed

## Test

Once setup is completed, 

> 
rails server

and open http://0.0.0.0:3000 .
